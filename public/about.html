<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Started out as a computer engineer but my boat flipped over and I ended up being the sailor that never sailed.</p>

<p>Took another stab at it years later; got throgh the associates level for comp sci, but then came crashing down during the upperclassmen courses--not once, but twice</p>

<p>Attempting a more subtle approach from Dixie Land by committing to a comprehensive review of material prior to launching--Lord willing--a reconquest of my comp sci degree, but with an emphasis on web development this time</p>
